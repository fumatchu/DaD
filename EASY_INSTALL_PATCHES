#Samba-dnf-pkgupdate- If Rocky was installed before January 11 2025, pkg update would not install dc rpm on upgrade. corrected.
#Please make sure you have manually set your DNS to something other than the Samba service before attempting to run this file
for example, use "nmtui" to edit the dns interface to 208.67.222.222 (OpenDNS), save and then run the commnad "systemctl restart NetworkManager", followed by nmcli to validate that the settings took effect.

If you receieve the error of:
Unable to save connection:           
802-3-ethernet.mac-address-denylist:
unknown property
(In nmtui)
you must "systemctl restart NetworkManager"
Modify the DNS entry to the DNS other than AD,  
then restart NetworkManager again before downloading the script 

Please keep in mind that this is also true if the script finds updates. YOU MAY run into this scenario above even if AD is operational and resolving
