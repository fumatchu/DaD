*********************************************

This script was created for ${GREEN}Rocky 9.x${TEXTRESET}
This script will quickly configure a Samba File/Print Server

 What this script does:
    1. Update and install all dependencies the Base OS.
    2. Add samba allowances to the Firewall
    3. Sets the SELinux to Passive mode (you should change this after install)
    4. Joins this server to the domain
    5. Creates an example share for AD integration

*********************************************

This will take around 10-15 minutes depending on your Internet connection
and processor speed/memory

    2. ${YELLOW}An Active User account${TEXTRESET} that you can use to test login to the Windows domain
    2. Verify that this server is ${YELLOW}configured to use the DNS services of AD.${TEXTRESET}
    3. Verify that the FQDN contains the ${YELLOW}REALM of the AD environment${TEXTRESET} you wish to join
