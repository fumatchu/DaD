*********************************************
            ATTENTION!
*********************************************
dnf_smb_mon sees a difference between the @System dnf repository
for Samba and the dnf repository upstream. This probably means that
the upstream Samba packages are a new version and the --dc packages
are now out of date.

Found versions: $VERSION1 and $VERSION2
You should probably run the command samba-dnf-pkg-update from the cli
or samba service management --> samba update (from server-manager).
